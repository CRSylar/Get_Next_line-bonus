# Get_Next_line
Get Next Line project for 42 school in Rome, completed with bonus

the function works pretty well, including the bonus part. However
i've got "only" 107/100 by Moulinette 
for a mistake on the bonus header file.

here is the final correct version

if you'r looking for some test try the "GNL-Lovers" test, is the most accurate we've found
OR "42TESTER-GNL"
this tests is NOT my code so just google it and credit the creator.
